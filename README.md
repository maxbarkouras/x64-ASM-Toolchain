# x64-ASM-Toolchain
An assembler and disassembler written in x64 assembly for the MIPS ISA (yes its crazy) 

**Usage:**
- For assembler, a MIPS file must be saved as *'assembly.asm'* in the same directory as program execution
- For disassembler, a *'machine.bin'* binary file must be saved in the same directory as program execution
  - This does not have to be assembled with the assembler, can be done using alternative programs like MARS
  - A text represented binary file is also allowed, literal 1s and 0s, which must be saved as "binary.bin"
- Run the assembler/disassembler and output files will be created in current directory
